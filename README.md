## Welcome to my tech task ðŸ‘‹

I have been working on this tech challenge from a frontend and a backend point of view.<br>
I used React.js for the frontend and I linked to an API server that I created using Express.js.<br>
During the development of this app I had the opportunity to use my React.js and Node.js knowledge but also to learn and apply new concepts and frameworks.
I mainly focused on functionalities rather than styling but I will link to this later on in the "areas of improvement" section.
